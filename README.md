# Solving-the-sales-man-problem-using-A-
this was an assignment to create a website that solves the sales man problem using python as the programing language and A* as the algorithm and later i used flask to deploy the website 
the A* algorithm was implemnted mostly by me but the usage of flask was somthing i did not know how to do so chat gpt helped a lot with explaining how to do it and the website is extremly simple so not much is happeining .
you can use the website localy by instaling flask ( pip install flask ) and then on any modern browser go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 .
one note before you actually deploy the website change the app.run(debug = True ) to False it may cause problems .
